"""
In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from
a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary(https://norvig.com/ngrams/sowpods.txt).
Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code.
This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in
professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.
